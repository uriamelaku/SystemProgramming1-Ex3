# String Linked List Project (EX3)

## Overview
This project is part of a system programming course assignment. The goal is to implement a dynamic linked list in C that stores and manipulates strings. The program is designed to handle various operations such as adding, removing, reversing, and sorting strings in the list. The main focus is on memory management, clean coding practices, and efficient use of dynamic allocations.

The project is structured into multiple files to separate the program logic and ensure modularity. The functionality is accessible through a menu-driven interface, which allows users to interact with the list and perform operations based on their choice.

## Features
The program includes the following operations:
1. **Add Strings**:
   - Users can add multiple strings (space-separated) to the list.
   - Each new string is appended at the end of the list.

2. **Insert String at Index**:
   - Insert a specific string at a given index in the list.

3. **Print List**:
   - Display all strings currently stored in the list.

4. **Print List Length**:
   - Show the total number of strings stored in the list.

5. **Print String by Index**:
   - Display the string located at a specific index.

6. **Count String Occurrences**:
   - Count how many times a particular string appears in the list.

7. **Remove All Instances of a String**:
   - Remove all occurrences of a specific string from the list.

8. **Remove by Index**:
   - Remove the string at a specified index.

9. **Reverse List**:
   - Reverse the order of all strings in the list.

10. **Clear List**:
    - Delete all strings and clear the list.

11. **Sort List**:
    - Sort the strings in lexicographical order.

12. **Check if Sorted**:
    - Verify whether the list is sorted lexicographically.

13. **Exit**:
    - Close the program.

## How to Compile and Run
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone the project repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
